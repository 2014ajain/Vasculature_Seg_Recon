# Histology Vasculature Segmentation and 3D Reconstruction
CIS II Project

General Outline 
1. Train Scala Network 
2. Train Vasculature Network 
3. Compress images and run inference on to generate scala masks
4. Create patches and run inference to generate vasculature masks
5. Register histology images and use transforms to align segmentations
6. Use 3D slicer to visualize stack of masks as 3D model
